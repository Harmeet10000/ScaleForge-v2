# Knock Notification System Learning Roadmap

This roadmap adapts your Novu-based guide to the **Knock** ecosystem. While the concepts are similar, Knock places a heavier emphasis on **Workflows** as the primary orchestration unit and uses **Users** instead of "Subscribers."

---

## 📚 Phase 1: Foundation & Setup (1-2 days)

### 1. Understanding Knock

- **What is Knock?**
  - SaaS notification infrastructure for complex logic.
  - API-first approach with a strong focus on observability.
  - Production-ready notification system with built-in analytics and debugging.

- **Key Concepts:**
  - **Workflows:** The logic tree that defines how/when notifications fire with visual builder.
  - **Users:** The recipients of your notifications with rich profile management.
  - **Objects:** Non-user entities (e.g., Projects, Teams, Documents) that can be notified.
  - **Tenants:** Used for B2B multi-tenancy (scoping preferences/branding per customer).
  - **Channels:** Providers (SendGrid, Twilio, APNS, FCM, Slack, etc.) with 50+ integrations.
  - **Schedules:** Time-based notification triggers with timezone support.
  - **Translations:** Multi-language support with locale-based message rendering.
  - **Subscriptions:** Manage user subscriptions to objects and topics.

### 2. Environment Setup

```bash
# Server-side SDK (Node.js/TypeScript)
npm install @knocklabs/node

## �️ Phase 2: Core Concepts & Implementation (3-4 days)

### 1. Initialize Knock Client

```javascript
const { Knock } = require('@knocklabs/node');
const knock = new Knock(process.env.KNOCK_API_KEY);
```

### 2. User Management (The "Identify" Pattern)

In Knock, you don't "create" subscribers; you **identify** users. This upserts the record.

**Advanced User Management Features:**

- Bulk user identification for onboarding
- Custom properties for segmentation
- User deletion with GDPR compliance
- User merging for duplicate accounts
- Channel data management (email, phone, push tokens)
- User metadata for workflow conditions
- Timezone support for scheduled notifications
- Locale preferences for translations

### 3. Triggering a Workflow

Workflows are triggered by a "Key."

**Workflow Trigger Capabilities:**

- Single or multiple recipients
- Actor tracking (who performed the action)
- Custom data payload for template variables
- Tenant scoping for multi-tenancy
- Cancellation tokens for workflow cancellation
- Idempotency keys for duplicate prevention
- Scheduled triggers with timezone support
- Batch triggering for bulk operations
- Conditional triggering based on user properties
- Workflow run tracking and status monitoring

---

## 🔄 Phase 3: Advanced Workflow Logic (2-3 days)

### 1. Logic Steps in the Dashboard

- **Delay:** Wait 5 minutes before sending with dynamic delay calculation.
- **Batching:** Group 10 "Like" notifications into one digest with custom windows.
- **Step Conditions:** Only send Email if the User has not seen the In-App notification within 1 hour.
- **Branching:** Route notifications based on user properties or data conditions.
- **Throttling:** Limit notification frequency per user (e.g., max 3 emails/day).
- **Channel Step:** Send to specific channels with fallback logic.
- **Fetch Step:** Enrich notification data from external APIs.
- **Function Step:** Custom JavaScript logic for complex conditions.

### 2. Preferences Management

Knock has a first-class Preference API. You don't have to build your own "Notification Settings" table.

**Preference System Features:**

- Channel-level preferences (email, SMS, push, in-app)
- Category-based preferences (marketing, transactional, social)
- Workflow-level granular control
- Tenant-scoped preferences for B2B
- Default preferences with inheritance

- Preference conditions (time-based, frequency-based)
- Bulk preference updates
- Preference history and audit trail
- Pre-built preference center UI components

**Advanced Preference Capabilities:**

- Quiet hours (don't disturb periods)
- Frequency capping (max notifications per period)
- Channel routing rules (prefer SMS over email)
- Conditional preferences based on user segments
- Preference overrides for critical notifications
- Preference import/export for migrations

---

## 🚀 Phase 4: Advanced Implementation (3-4 days)
